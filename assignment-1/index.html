                        <p>
                            Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
                            Way up high<br>
                            There's a land that I heard of<br>
                            Once in a lullaby
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
                            Skies are blue<br>
                            And the dreams that you dare to dream<br>
                            Really do come true
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Someday I'll wish upon a star<br>
                            And wake up where the clouds are far behind me<br>
                            Where troubles melt like lemon drops<br>
                            Away above the chimney tops<br>
                            That's where you'll find me
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Somewhere over the rainbow<br>
                            Bluebirds fly<br>
                            Birds fly over the rainbow<br>
                            Why then, oh why can't I?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If happy little bluebirds fly<br>
                            Beyond the rainbow<br>
                            Why, oh why can't I?
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Judy Garland, born Frances Ethel Gumm in 1922, was one of the greatest entertainers of the twentieth century. She began her career in vaudeville as a child and was signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. Her potrayal of Dorothy Gale in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> at age sixteen made her an international star and cemented her place in Hollywood history.
